Fluently
Language learning applications are widely used, but most fail to provide personalized lessons and feedback based on a userâ€™s real-time performance. This project aims to bridge this gap by creating a language learning app that adapts question difficulty dynamically based on user performance in open-ended exercises. The app generates personalized lessons for each user based on their skill level and analyzes user responses using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to provide real-time feedback on grammar, vocabulary, and semantic comprehension.

How to Run:
Open a terminal window cd language-learning-app
Run uvicorn backend.app:main --reload to start the server
Open a new terminal window and cd language-learning-app/app
To start the application, run npm run dev
How to Use:
Create a User Account to track learning progress
Generate a quick language lesson that will evaluate your responses using NLP techniques
Further your learning!
